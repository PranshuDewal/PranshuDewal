# Enterprise Platform Delivery

# Pranshu Mohan Dewal
Technology leader in enterprise delivery, data platforms, and applied AI. I care deeply about building lean systems that work in the real world—under scale, navigating regulation and long-term operational constraints.

I have led and delivered large-scale, data-intensive enterprise platforms in production environments across energy, transportation, and other regulated domains. This repository is intended as a practical reference for teams operating in high-stakes production environments. 

My focus on execution has been around: system design, delivery governance, data integrity, cutover discipline, and post-production stabilization.

## What I have done
- Multi-application enterprise programs (30+ platforms)
- Data governance, migration, and system integration at scale
- AI-assisted optimization applied to delivery execution
- High-availability cutovers and production stabilization

## Scope of responsibility
- End-to-end delivery leadership and technical ownership
- Architecture and data design review
- Release and cutover decision authority
- Coaching product owners, analysts, and engineering teams

## Leadership
- Clear decision-making (ADRs, go/no-go criteria, documented tradeoffs)
- Reliability over heroics (runbooks, monitoring, stabilization discipline)
- Coaching and leverage (develop owners, unblock teams, keep systems evolvable)
