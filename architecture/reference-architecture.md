# Reference Enterprise Platform Architecture

This document outlines a generalized architecture used for
modernizing legacy enterprise platforms.

## Key characteristics
- Decoupled services with clearly defined interfaces
- Centralized data governance and lineage
- Separation of ingestion, processing, and consumption layers
- Built-in observability and release controls

## Typical layers
1. Source systems (legacy apps, ERP, operational platforms)
2. Ingestion and integration (APIs, batch, event-driven)
3. Data processing and validation
4. Analytics and operational reporting
5. Security, identity, and access controls

The architecture prioritizes reliability, traceability, and controlled evolution.
